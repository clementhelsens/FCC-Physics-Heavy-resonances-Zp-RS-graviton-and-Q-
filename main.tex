for searches of new particles decaying to two high energetic leptons, tops or W/Z boson. We discuss the expected exclusion limits and discovery potential for benchmark models

\section{Introduction}
The design of a 100 TeV proton-proton collider leads to many challenges for detector design. Detailed optimizations of the detector is needed in order to achieve the required physics goals. The capabilities of such a detector should include the capabilities of measuring multi-TeV leptons, top-quarks and bosons.

\subsection{Monte-Carlo production}
\label{subsec:mcprod}

All the signal Monte-Carlo events have been produced directly with Pythia 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Fit model}
Despite the fact that very large amount of Monte-Carlo statistic has been simulated in bins of $\hht$, there are still large statistical fluctuations from high weight events.
In order to reduce this effect, a function is used to fit the background distribution,
\begin{equation}
f(z)=p_1(1-z)^{p_2}z^{p_3}z^{p_{4}logz}
\end{equation}
where $z=m_{jj}/\sqrt{s}$. This fit is used in order to have a smooth shape for the backgrounds, while the normalisation is taken prior to the fit (see figure~\ref{fig:hadronicresonances_nofit}).

\subsection{Detector parameterizations}

The FCC study group is using the Delphes software package to emulate the response a detector. 
For the FCC one the baseline parameters are:
We also consider two variations around it as well as the CMS configuration.

\subsection{Multi-Variate based selection}
\label{subsec:mvatagger}

- design 2 taggers to perform Whad and thad separation with QCD,
- made pythia independent samples from analysis, QCD has been produced to avoid useless events and to perform that the filtering has been chosen to ensure to have similar signal leading jet $\pT$ (pTHatMin = 2500, bias2Selection = on, bias2SelectionPow = 6.)
- the statistics obtained for Whad, thad and QCD are respectively 1M, 1M and 920k events with 2 jets, each jet will be an entry for the BDT training,
%- the BDT parameters for training are : !H:!V:NTrees=600:MaxDepth=4:BoostType=AdaBoost:AdaBoostBeta=0.15:SeparationType=GiniIndex:nCuts=100:PruneMethod=NoPruning
- a training selection is applied to remove uselees events with isolated leptons and jets for which jet $\tau$ ratio variables failed (i.e has a negative value)
- the training statistics obtained for Whad, thad and QCD are respectively 1117500, 1432192 and 1578098 jets, half of the stat is used for training and the other half for testing
- the variables are defined to be the same as the ones used to perform cut-based associated analysis ($\Zp \rightarrow \ttbar$ in section~\ref{subsec:Zptt} and $G \rightarrow WW$ in section~\ref{subsec:RSGww} ) and the idea is to fully exploit these informations thanks to the BDT, variable list and ranking in table~\ref{tab:TMVA_summary}
- the BDT performances in plots, 
- removing fully correlated variables have tried and doesn't change anything to performances shown
- the BDT response has been shown (\ref{fig:BDT_signal_shape_comparison}) for different signal masses generation to see how much analysis can be mass dependent. From the cuts defined in the analysis level at 0.15, the BDT shape reponse difference is not changing so much the proportion of signal kept and it removes 90\% and 95\% of QCD for thad and Whad taggers respectively

\section{Physics models}
\label{sec:physmodel}

Models with extended gauge groups often feature additional U(1) symmetries with corresponding heavy spin-1 bosons. These bosons, generally referred to as $\Zp$, would manifest as a narrow resonance through
its  decay,  in  the  dilepton  mass  spectrum.   
Among  these  models  are  those  inspired  by  Grand  Unified Theories, which are 
motivated by gauge unification or a restoration of the left–right symmetry violated
by the weak interaction. Examples are the $\Zp$
bosons of the E6 motivated [1, 2] theories as well as Minimal models [3].  
The Sequential Standard Model (SSM) [2] posits a $\ZpSSM$ boson with couplings to fermions
that are identical to those of the SM $\Z$ boson. This model is a good benchmark as the 
results can be interpreted in the context of other models of new physics, and is useful 
for comparing the sensitivity of different experiments.

\section{Conclusion}
This note presents preliminary studies of a search for $\Zp$ 
bosons decaying into two electrons or muons in the FCC context. The expected number 
of signal and background events have been estimated from simulated truth level information 
after applying smearing functions to mimic the FCC detector response.
Using a cut-based analysis and assuming simplistic systematic uncertainties, $\ZpSSM$
masses below 40 $\TeV$ can be excluded at 95$\%$ C.L. 
using 30 $\afb{}$ of data.
