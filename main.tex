\begin{abstract}
This paper explores the physics reach of the proton-proton Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) and High Energy LHC (HE-LHC) 
for searches of new particles decaying to two high energetic leptons, jets (non-tops), tops and W/Z boson. We discuss the expected exclusion limits and discovery potential for benchmark models 
predicting new massive particles that result in resonant structures in the invariant mass spectrum. The study is based on the Madgraph5 and Pythia8 Monte Carlo generators using large event statistics for the FCC running conditions. 
This document also includes a detailed study on the discrimination potential of a $\Zp$ at HE-LHC in case of discovery at the end of High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).
