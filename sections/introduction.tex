\section{Introduction}
discovery potential of heavy gauge resonance $\Zp$ and center of mass energy $\sqrt[]{s} =100$~TeV makes it the ultimate machine for such new particles, and are also extremely relevant to discuss the main limitations of the detector to tag high energetic top-quarks or W/Z bosons.
The design of a 100 TeV proton-proton collider leads to many challenges for detector design. Detailed optimizations of the detector is needed in order to achieve the required physics goals. The capabilities of such a detector should include the capabilities of measuring multi-TeV leptons, top-quarks and bosons.
