\section{Introduction}
The design of a 100 TeV proton-proton collider leads to many challenges for detector design. Detailed optimizations of the detector is needed in order to achieve the required physics goals. The capabilities of such a detector should include the capabilities of measuring multi-TeV leptons, top-quarks and bosons.
