\section{Model discrimination at HE-LHC}
The 14 TeV LHC with L=3 ab$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity can search for new $Z'$ gauge bosons from the classic extended gauge theories up to masses 
of roughly $\simeq 6$ TeV.  Here we analyzed the capability of the 27 TeV HE-LHC with L=15 ab$^{-1}$ to distinguish among six $Z'$ models employing only 
the $e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$ channels assuming that $M_{Z'}=6$ TeV. Under the assumption that these $Z'$'s decay only to SM particles,  we show that 
there are sufficient observables to perform this model differentiation in most cases. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Context of the study}
It is legitimate to assume that a heavy resonance could be seen at the end of High Luminosity LHC (HL-HLC). If that is the case a new collider with higher energy 
in the center of mass is needed to study its property as not enough events will be available at 14~TeV. In this document we present the discrimination potential of a High Energy LHC (HE-LHC)
with an assumed center of mass energy of 27~TeV.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Bounds from HL-LHC}
As a starting point it is needed to understand what are, for $\sqrt s=14$ TeV, for the typical exclusion/discovery reaches for some standard reference $Z'$ models assuming L=3 ab$^{-1}$ 
employing only the $e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$ channels. To address this and the other questions below we will use the same set of $Z'$ models as employed 
in \cite{Rizzo:2014xma} and mostly in \cite{Han:2013mra}, both of which we will refer to frequently. We employ the MMHT2014 NNLO set \cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} 
throughout with an appropriate constant $K$-factor (=1.27) for numerics. 
The upper panel in Fig.~\ref{toy} shows the production cross section times leptonic BF for these models at 14 TeV in the NWA. It has 
been and will be assumed here that these $Z'$ states only decay to SM particles. 

Using the present ATLAS and CMS results at 13 TeV, \cite{Aaboud:2017buh} and \cite{Sirunyan:2018exx}, it is straightforward to estimate by extrapolation the eventual 14 TeV 
exclusion reach in the combined $e+\mu$ sample; this is given in the first column of Table~\ref{spec}. For discovery, only the $e$ channel is used due to poor $\mu$-pair mass 
resolution near $M_{Z'}=6$ TeV although the muons will add some additional support for any observed excess as large masses. Estimates of the $3\sigma$ evidence and $5\sigma$ 
discovery limits are also given in the Table. Based on these results, we will assume in our study below that we are dealing with a $Z'$ of mass 6 TeV; somewhat smaller mass 
choices will lead to very similar conclusions based on the ratio of predicted event rates shown in the lower panel of Fig.~\ref{toy}.  Fig.\ref{toy2} shows the NWA cross 
sections for the same set of models but now at 27 TeV; with L=15 ab$^{-1}$, we note that very large statistical samples will be available for the case of $M_{Z'}=6$ TeV 
for each dilepton channel.

\subsection{Discrimination from direct calculations}
Question: Can we use just this dilepton channel to distinguish between these six $Z'$ models? 
\newline
\\
We make use of 3 observables, all in NWA: $\sigma B_l$, the forward-backward asymmetry, $A_{FB}$ and the rapidity ratio, $r_y$. These last two are defined 
and discussed at some extent in both \cite{Rizzo:2014xma} and \cite{Han:2013mra}.  Given the ATLAS and CMS analyses as presented in \cite{Han:2016qpd} 
and \cite{CMS:2017zzj} we employ the entire range of rapidity $|y|\leq 2.5$ in defining these quantities. Based on these same works and \cite{Han:2013mra}, 
In addition to usual statistical errors, we will assume a $2\%$ systematic error on the two ratios as most uncertainties (lumi and PDF) will cancel between numerators 
and denominators. For $\sigma B_l$, we assign a $5\%$ systematic error in addition to this $2\%$; all errors are then added in quadrature. I am aware that these may 
be aggressive numbers but the plots will tell all.

\caption{ Same as the top panel in the previous Figure but now for the HE-LHC.}
\label{toy2}
\end{figure}



Fig.~\ref{toy3} shows the correlated predictions for these 3 observables for these six models given the above assumptions and employing {\it only} a single dilepton 
channel. Here we see that apart from a possible near degeneracy in models $\psi,\eta$, a reasonable $Z'$ model separation is indeed achieved. It is clear that this 
remains possible even with somewhat larger values for the systematic errors. I note again that the use of $\sigma B_l$ relies on the absence of new non-SM decay 
modes.

\subsection{Discrimination from detector level analysis}
The analyses presented in this section are all performed within the FCC software framework, FCCSW~\cite{fccsw}.
The detector parametrisation considered in this study is from HE-LHC official parametrisation for the yellow report~\cite{HELHCtwiki}.
The Monte Carlo are first presented in Section~\ref{subsection:MC} Leptonic decays are presented in~\ref{subsection:lepana}, and hadronic analyses in~\ref{subsection:hadana}.


\subsubsection{Monte Carlo Samples}
\label{subsection:MC}
Monte Carlo~(MC) simulated event samples were used to simulate the response of the FCC detector to signal and backgrounds. The muon momentum resolution 
is assumed to be $\sigma(p)/p \approx 20\%$ at $\pt= 20 $TeV. Signals are generated with {\scshape Pythia}~8.230~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} using the leading 
order cross-section from the generator. All lepton flavour decays of the $Z'$ are generated assuming universality of the couplings.
The Drell-Yan background has been generated using {\scshape MG5\_}a{\scshape MC@NLO}~2.5.2~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} at leading order only. 
A k-factor of 2 is applied to all the background processes.



\subsubsection{Leptonic analysis}
\label{subsection:lepana}
\subsubsubsection{Event selection and discovery potential}

Events are required to contain at least two same flavour leptons of opposite charge with $\pt > 500$~GeV, $|\eta|<$4.5. 
When mentioned a smaller acceptance of $|\eta|<$2.5 is considered to test the impact on the reduction of the statistics. 
An additional cut on the di-lepton invariant mass $m_{ll}>1$~TeV is applied to remove the low mass Drell-Yan. 
Figure~\ref{figure:lepana:mass} shows the invariant mass for a 6~TeV signal for the $ee$ (left) and $\mu\mu$ channels (right). 
The mass resolution is better for the ee channel, as expected from the higher performance of the electro-magnetic calorimeter at high energy.

\label{sec:lepana}
\begin{figure}[h]

   \caption{Invariant mass for a 6~TeV signal after full event selection for ee channel (left) and $\mu\mu$ channel (right).}
  \label{figure:lepana:mass}
\end{figure}

Limits and discovery potential for di-lepton resonances are shown in Figure~\ref{figure:lepana:limdisc}. With the full 15~ab$^{-1}$ 
integrated luminosity, it is expected to exclude heavy $Z'$ resonances from 10 to 12.5~TeV depending on the model and discover 
a $Z'_{SSM}$ up to 12~TeV.

  \caption{Limit versus mass for the di-lepton channel (left) and luminosity for a $5\sigma$ discovery (right) for the ee and $\mu\mu$ combined channels. }
  \label{figure:lepana:limdisc}
\end{figure}


\subsubsubsection{Variables definition}
\label{subsubsection:vardef}

As for the analysis from direct calculation, the observables are defined at the detector level. On Figure~\ref{figure:lepana:yzp} the 
rapidity of the $Z'$ is displayed, and as expected it is much more central for the signal than for the Drell-Yan background.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{Fig/yzp_sel0_lin_norm_ee.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{Fig/yzp_sel0_lin_norm_mumu.eps}
  \caption{$Z'$ rapidity distribution comparing a 6~TeV signal and Drell-Yan background for ee (left) and $\mu\mu$ channels (right).}
  \label{figure:lepana:yzp}
\end{figure}

At detector level the variable $r_y$ is defined as the ratio of central over forward events:
\begin{equation}
r_y = \frac{\sigma(|y_{Z'}| < y_1)}{\sigma(y_1 < |y_{Z'}| <y_2)}
\end{equation}
with $y_1=0.5$ and $y_2=2.5$ for this study.

The variable $A_{FB}$ can be seen as a measure of the charge asymmetry
\begin{equation}
A_{FB} = A_C =  \frac{\sigma(\Delta|y| > 0) - \sigma(\Delta|y| < 0)}{\sigma(\Delta|y| > 0) + \sigma(\Delta|y| < 0)}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta|y| = |y_l| - |y_{\bar{l}}|$. It has been checked that this definition is equivalent to defining 
\begin{equation}
A_{FB} =   \frac{\sigma_F - \sigma_B}{\sigma_F + \sigma_B}
\end{equation}
with $\sigma_F = \sigma (cos\theta^{*}_{cs})>0$ and $\sigma_B = \sigma (cos\theta^{*}_{cs})<0$ and defining $\theta^*$ in the Collins-Soper 
frame as
\begin{equation}
cos\theta^{*}_{cs} =  \frac{Q_z}{|Q_z|} \frac{2(P_l^+P_{\bar{l}}^- - P_l^-P_{\bar{l}}^+)}{|Q| \sqrt{Q^2+Q^2_T}}
\end{equation}
where $Q$, $Q_T$ and $Q_z$ are the four-momentum, the transverse momentum, and the longitudinal
momentum of the di-lepton pair. $P_{l}(P_{\bar{l}})$ represents the four momenta of the lepton (anti-lepton),
and $P^\pm_l = (P^0_l \pm P^3_l)$.


\subsubsubsection{Optimisations}
\label{subsubsection:opti}
In Figure~\ref{figure:lepana:afb_dm} is represented $A_{FB}$ verus the acceptance window around a 6TeV signal. 
It is shown for signal only (top-left) and is flat as expected. Once background is introduced without uncertainties (top-right), and when the window 
becomes too large the asymmetry is diluted. When adding a 10\% uncertainty on the background (bottom-left) we observe as expected larger errors and quicker dilution.
The last plot (bottom-left) shows the same variable, but considering the full interference between the signal and the Drell-Yann. One can immediately 
note the fact that the dilution goes in opposite direction as when not considering the interference.

\end{table}

We have checked that increasing the acceptance of the leptons to 4.5 in pseudo-rapidity did not improved the discrimination further. 
Using a profile likelihood technique, the signal strength $\mu$ can be fitted together with its corresponding error. 


\subsubsection{Hadronic analysis}

From the leptonic analysis~\ref{sec:lepana}, it was shown that for $r_y$ 
For all cases, except for a mass of 8TeV and an integrated luminosity of 5ab$^{-1}$, discrimination is obtained at more than one sigma for the di-jet case.
