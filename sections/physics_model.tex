\section{Physics models}
\label{sec:physmodel}

Models with extended gauge groups often feature additional U(1) symmetries with corresponding heavy spin-1 bosons. These bosons, generally referred to as $\Zp$, would manifest as a narrow resonance through
its  decay,  in  the  dilepton  mass  spectrum.   
Among  these  models  are  those  inspired  by  Grand  Unified Theories, which are 
motivated by gauge unification or a restoration of the leftâ€“right symmetry violated
by the weak interaction. Examples are the $\Zp$
bosons of the E6 motivated [1, 2] theories as well as Minimal models [3].  
The Sequential Standard Model (SSM) [2] posits a $\ZpSSM$ boson with couplings to fermions
that are identical to those of the SM $\Z$ boson. This model is a good benchmark as the 
results can be interpreted in the context of other models of new physics, and is useful 
for comparing the sensitivity of different experiments.
