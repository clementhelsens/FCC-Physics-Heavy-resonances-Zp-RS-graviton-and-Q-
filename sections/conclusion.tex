\section{Conclusion}
This note presents preliminary studies of a search for $\Zp$ 
bosons decaying into two electrons or muons in the FCC context. The expected number 
of signal and background events have been estimated from simulated truth level information 
after applying smearing functions to mimic the FCC detector response.
Using a cut-based analysis and assuming simplistic systematic uncertainties, $\ZpSSM$
masses below 40 $\TeV$ can be excluded at 95$\%$ C.L. 
using 30 $\afb{}$ of data.
